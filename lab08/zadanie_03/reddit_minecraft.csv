I don't wanna spend my whole life playing soulslikes. When I play a game, story and lore comes first, But I actually enjoy a challange and learning how the game actually works. In those cases, the gameplay feels like it's part of the atmosphere for me, and a perfect representation of character growth.

But I don't feel any joy in doing that with a fighting game because everything feels so... ""bare-bones"" in my opinion. I enjoy playing around with a well established concept or universe, not just being told: ""That's your character and here's a training dummy. Figure it out"". Like- I don't even find minecraft fun for this exact same reason. I like challanges with some sort of ""fuel"" in the background.

This is a question I've been wondering as someone who didn't have the money to buy consoles/pcs, and even now it's all second hand stuff. 

In 2014-2015 when I was around 6, my aunt gifted me my first ever console, a Playstation 2 slim. I didn't have internet access or any friends that did, so this was my first time gaming outside of an arcade. Didn't even know what an Xbox was at this point, and to me the PS2 was the latest and greatest thing ever. I remember playing some Cars game I don't remember, as well as a Ninja Turtles game I also don't remember. However I spent most of my time on on Gran Turismo 4. Since it was second hand, it didn't last very long, about a year I think. Sat without a console for a few months I believe.

So, videogame prices have been stagnant at $60 for a long time, but are finally increasing to $70, $80, or even $90 for the base price of a game. Why?

Well, to learn why, we need to look at a few things.

The first is an inflation calculator. Using the [BLS.gov](http://BLS.gov) inflation calculator, we can see that a $50 game in 2005, the price of videogames back then, is worth $95 in today's money.

A lot of couples play together there. Ive also played World of Warcraft in the past with lots of couples. Was once in a couples only guild even lmao. But WoW isn't as popular these days. If I had this thought pop into my head 15 years ago, WoW would be the obvious answer to me.

Mine is FFXIV, I suppose.

Do I need to rebuy 2 more copies of the game and buy online services for both accounts?

Fallout 76 had a large update where playable ghouls are now in the game. This has been requested for a good while now, and has pretty consistent, if small, content updates.

Minecraft has been more successful in theatre's than I think they planned, and there's a large graphical update coming out this summer that has been requested for years now. 

Oblivion Remake was just leaked, and is looking like it is going to release end of April.

The Elder Scrolls Online also has had a new Expansion announced, and is still doing better than most people, myself included - would have ever imagined. 

Doom: Dark Ages comes out in May and by all accounts looks like it's going to be another I credible entry in the Doom franchise.

Outer Worlds 2 will hopefully be an improved iteration on the already well received Outer Worlds 1.

I am sure I am missing others.

My friend plays on PC and I on PS5. We‚Äôre trying to find games we can play together since so far we‚Äôve only got Minecraft and Outlast Trials.

We‚Äôre both women so want female character customisation, and would prefer something open world with decent graphics. We both quite like sandboxy creative type games. Any recommendations are appreciated :) ",9,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ii8o1f/open_world_crossplay_game_recs/

I play at least 2 hours a day (I know that doesn't touch a lot of players numbers). It's usually during the day if I'm working from home; I'll play on my lunch break, then again at some point in the evening. Naturally I play a lot more on the weekends or lazy days, but I never shirk my duties as a dad, and rarely play between when she gets home from school and when she goes to bed. But of course she still see me play a fair amount. 

I'm not a ""yeller."" I don't have a headset. I'm a pretty even keeled player, mostly first person shooters and survival games, but nothing gorey. She's sat and watched me play FO76 multiple times and thinks my  tattered mole head is ""cute,"" but that's the extent of it. She does play Minecraft on her phone a fair amount, but the console doesn't interest her.

I started playing Minecraft around the days of version 1.6, so while I wasn't new to the party I was still in the early days of Minecraft.

After being burned out by the new Minecraft updates I decided to go back to the time where I started playing Minecraft, no mods no nothing. Just Minecraft 1.6

So I fired up the Game and after about 2 hours of playing I started to realize that it's just not the same, I just can't relive the glory day's of this Game anymore",1235,1082,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1idp0tn/what_game_have_you_played_wanting_to_relive_the/

It's more of your rationale for why you made that choice. Do you go with your favorite game of all time? Your favorite story? The most challenging? The one that has the most variability? 

For me, my favorite game of all time is Chrono Trigger. This is a single player story driven JRPG. That being the case, it is a very similar playthrough every time I play it.

Diablo 2 is a game where the end game is just loot farming, dueling, and theory crafting new builds. It's also online, so this would provide a lot of variability and the social aspect.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a metroidvania with beautiful music, fluid controls, and it just feels really good to play. Lately I've been playing a randomizer of the game, which shuffle what upgrades you get in each location, making the game play different every time I play it.

However I do have many games that have always been by my side and played for HOURS. My total for GTAO, MC and For Honor are about 8k, add Rocket League and Binding of Isaac I might just reach 10k hours total. 

With that being said I think For Honor, MC and GTA are my biggest achievements when talking about stories. From starting in January of 2017 in Online to the release of Doomsday DLC or Casino update, it‚Äôs got so many stories and ways to play that I just couldn‚Äôt stop playing until it was my number 1. My favorite story to tell is staying up late with people, trading ‚Äúmodded‚Äù cars and making deals with creators to get free rides or just simple to help out and get more people into doing glitches. I started when DMO was first discovered and although I never touched it seeing the people who did were like magic.

\-Mobile ports that thought their controls were just as good as console or KB&M controls

\-Limited playtime per day+pay to play more and pay to win, and audience-driven advertisement/player recruitment (Farmville). More pay to win in CoD, Battlefield, Street Fighter X Tekken, Assassin's Creed III, etc.

\-Game or platform specific currency converted from real currency (Farmville, VC, XBLA, etc.)

\-Ephemeral gaming (online/digital only games that are eventually taken offline with no legal way to access them)

\-The Minecraft approach of not tutorializing anything properly, and the main game mode being an afterthought but still in the game. And auto-pickup

\-How legal emulation lagged behind features- and library-wise

\-Achievement pop-ups where it didn't suit the game

Here are her demands:

Game must be vibrant, like botw, but not necessarily cell shaded. She says skyrim is too depressing looking and scary.

Game must include homestead mechanics. She really likes stardew valley for this reason but doesn't necessarily like the graphics. Same with animal crossing, she thinks the npcs are too cartoony looking. Basically she wants to be able to build a farm and decorate/build a house. And cook food

She would prefer if the game had a character creator.

She wants kind of like an rpg with quests and a story and stuff.

And so we landed on no mans sky but she doesn't necessarily enjoy all the exploring/resource management you have to do.
