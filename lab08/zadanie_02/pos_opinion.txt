The building where the apartment is located is breathtaking, not to mention its history! The room is very spacious,
clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. It feels truly luxurious.
The ceiling height is so high that you can stand without any problems on the upper level.
Fully equipped kitchen with dishwasher.
There's a food hall with all kinds of options, from polish to international cuisine and a convenience store on the
ground level, which is super convenient. At first, I wasn't sure about the location, but in fact, it's great,
close to all the main attractions of the city. Probably one of the best places to stay in Gda≈Ñsk!
