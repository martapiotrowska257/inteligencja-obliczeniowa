The hotel is just a building with absolutely no service!!!
The people at the reception desk are nice and polite, but totally clueless and very poorly trained.
They seem well intentioned but completely unable to solve any problems.
I was overcharged by about $600. At check-in I notified the hotel that one of the guests won't be joining us.
They acknowledged that, but did not make any adjustments to the bill.
Since they didn't tell me that, I assumed, that I was being billed the correct amount.
Yes, you pay per person, not per room (!!) When I got home, I contacted the property and requested a revision of my bill.
They were very confrontational and rude about it. They said that it was a booking.com problem and not theirs.
I contacted booking.com and they contacted the property, but nobody as of yet has replied to them.
The director of the property sadly seems to exhibit a homo sovieticus way of thinking -- the guest is always wrong!
We stayed for 6 days, ended up renting 3 rooms, ate at the property at least 2 times a day.
We did give them a lot of business. I'm not asking for any favors, just a fair invoice.
I don't want to pay for something I haven't received.
I have lived outside of Poland for 30 years now, but I come back at least once a year.
I have to say that the customer service at nearly all of the hotels I stayed at is world class, not so at the Montownia
There is also no housekeeping at the hotel, which you only find out at check-in. When you are staying a day or two,
it's probably ok, but we stayed for 6 days!!
I wish I had known that there is no breakfast buffet!
When you book the hotel, you have the option of pre- paying for breakfast, so they are charging you PLN70 for something
they are not providing. You can order something off the restaurant menu,
but it never adds up to PLN70 and it doesn’t carry over to the next day.
I paid twice as much for breakfast as I should have, so DO NOT PRE- PAY. It’s virtually a scam.
